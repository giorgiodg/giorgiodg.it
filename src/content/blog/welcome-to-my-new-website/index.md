After spending some time thinking about my online presence, I decided it was time for a refresh.  
I wanted something simpler, faster, and easier to maintain than the previous setup.

So I chose [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) because it’s a lightweight and fast framework. Within a few days, I had a working site that feels just right.

This is my personal website, where you’ll find information [about me](/about), my professional [skills](/skills), and some [testimonials](/testimonials) from colleagues I’ve worked with and, finally, a new [blog](/blog) section that I’ll occasionally curate.

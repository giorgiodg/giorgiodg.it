If you're based in Italy and you own a car or a motorcycle, you'll have to pay the "bollo" tax whether you use it or not.
This tax is basically a yearly road tax you pay just for owning a vehicle.

But when you go to pay it, whether through online banking, the post office, or a shop, the payment service usually **adds a commission of around €1–3**.

[Here](https://medium.com/@giorgio.dg/come-pagare-il-bollo-auto-moto-con-revolut-senza-commissioni-7594bb340312) I wrote a simple guide (in Italian) to avoid this commission by using Revolut.

So, why you should pay more when you can spend that money for a caffè and cornetto? Go and check my guide!

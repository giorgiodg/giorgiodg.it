The reason is pretty simple.
When it comes to job search, at least in the Tech space, it's no longer enough to showcase your skills on the CV.

Recruiters will look not only at your LinkedIn, but also at your GitHub and portfolio website.

So, I needed something that could give me exposure to hands-on topics which are essential for any DevOps/cloud/platform engineering.
The [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) is perfect to test those skills.

I have written a collection of posts to share my learnings along the way.

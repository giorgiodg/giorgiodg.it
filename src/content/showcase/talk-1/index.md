Mini Agile Day Bari was a one-day event held in Bari on March 10, 2018, organised by local developer communities.
This talk explores the multi-year transformation of Hotels.com's engineering organization from a monolithic setup with long release cycles to a fast-paced continuously delivering ecosystem. Through phases of outsourcing, in-sourcing, and Agile adoption, we showed how the Hotels.com brand reduced time-to-market, embraced CI/CD, and fostered a culture of ownership and experimentation across global teams.

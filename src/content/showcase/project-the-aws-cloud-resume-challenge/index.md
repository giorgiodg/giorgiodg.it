I built my own version of the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge, a community-driven initiative designed to help engineers gain practical cloud experience.
The project combines front-end development, serverless APIs, and infrastructure as code to deploy a fully automated, cloud-native personal website.

Through this challenge, I implemented:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for reproducible deployments
- Serverless backend (API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB)
- Static site hosting with global CDN
- Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline

It was a great opportunity to consolidate best practices in automation, cloud governance, and end-to-end delivery workflows — all using real-world tooling and production-grade setups.

I built my own version of the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge, a community-driven initiative designed to help engineers gain practical cloud experience.
The project combines front-end development, serverless APIs, and infrastructure as code to deploy a fully automated, cloud-native personal website.

Through this challenge, I implemented:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via Terraform for reproducible deployments
- Serverless backend (Lambda and DynamoDB)
- Front-end via Astro, JavaScript and Tailwind
- Hosting with Cloudfront, S3 and IAM
- CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions

It was a great opportunity to consolidate best practices in automation, cloud governance, and end-to-end delivery workflows, all using real-world tooling and production-grade setups.
